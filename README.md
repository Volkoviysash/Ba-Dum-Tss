<h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>This web drum pad app is a fantastic tool for both aspiring and seasoned drummers to practice their skills and explore different sounds. With its intuitive user interface, I can easily create beats and rhythms by simply clicking on the various virtual pads on the screen. The app offers a range of pre-loaded drum kits with different sounds and effects to choose from, and I can also customize my own drum kits to suit my unique preferences. Additionally, the app allows me to record and save my creations, enabling me to listen back and refine my work. Overall, my web drum pad app is a fun and user-friendly way for drummers to hone their craft and experiment with different sounds and rhythms.</p>
